# Galactic Gladiators
Assignment for uni. Basically Stratego but some units have special powers and tiles.
However it does not contain lakes and also its really ugly (graphics drawn by me)

## How to play
At the start of a game you get to place your units by clicking the highlighted squares.
You can pick up a unit by clicking it again during this phase.
The unit currently being placed is shown left of the board.

After you've placed all of your units, the game starts and you have to move one of your units.
Select a unit to move, and then select a tile for it to move to.
If the tile your trying to move to is occupied, a fight sequence will start. The unit with the highest rank wins (in a draw, the attacker loses)
To use the special power of a unit, select it, then click it again.
The special powers will be shown on hover.
Once either of the players have captured their opponents flag, the game ends.
Each unit of your color rewards 1 gold at the end.
Capturing the opponents flag rewards 10 gold.
Whichever player has the most gold wins.

## Special tiles
The game features a couple of special tiles that affect the gameplay in various ways.
Hover over these tiles to read what they do when a unit is on it.

## The CPU
The cpu player picks moves randomly, with a bias towards special moves.
If you want an actual challenge in this game, try losing instead of winning.
